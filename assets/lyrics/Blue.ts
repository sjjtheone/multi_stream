[00:00.87]Ah, like every day I see
[00:03.37]Another day repeats, I’m yawning all the time
[00:07.12]After all the cheers, the night, it fades out and
[00:10.37]Shibuya receives a pour of the morning light
[00:14.76]And somehow, an emptiness surrounds
[00:17.51]That’s what I always feel
[00:19.51]Something is not enough
[00:21.25]That’s how it’s gonna be
[00:23.01]It’s all a part of life
[00:25.00]I’ll let this be
[00:26.01]See what, see what, covered deep inside
[00:28.50]Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on
[00:32.75]Pretending won’t bring it out of sight
[00:35.50]It is always waiting there for you
[00:39.00]Ah, Calling followed, what I feel’s to be drawn
[00:42.76]Going by my selection in this color, then
[00:46.26]Suddenly, with the breeze of a drowsy morning
[00:50.01]There was a world of blue shown in front of me
[00:53.51]Liking what you believe in and saying that you do
[00:57.01]Can be too terrifying, but I know
[01:00.26]I’ve finally come across a true discovery of what I got
[01:15.51]Ah, the more that I reach out my hands to what I need
[01:19.64]The further it becomes
[01:21.89]Another one of these unruly days go on
[01:25.64]I’m always in a hurry as I’m struggling
[01:29.39]Misery, stemming from all my thoughts
[01:32.39]Humiliation brings new tears into my view
[01:35.89]The more that I step in, the harder it becomes
[01:39.39]Even the pain renews
[01:43.14]Ah, Calling followed, what I feel is the move
[01:46.89]Going by my selection in this path I walk
[01:50.39]On a night fighting off eyelids dropping heavy
[01:53.89]I’m grabbing tight, the blue vow in front of me
[01:57.64]Taking what you believe and to keep doing so
[02:01.14]Every step’s not only fun all the time
[02:04.14]Don’t know if I’m able, cause I am worried a little
[02:08.39]Ah, “one line” was drawn
[02:10.14]Every “one line” was drawn
[02:12.14]Missing inner confidence, I’ve drawn all pages I could draw
[02:15.64]Ah, “one time” becomes
[02:17.39]Every “one time” becomes
[02:19.14]Soon, a large accumulation of a strength inside of you
[02:22.89]All around, I look at them
[02:24.39]Comparing what I do with them
[02:26.14]What is it only I can do that nobody else can？
[02:29.89]Even if I’ve got no true confidence, I’m moving on
[02:35.64]Covered in thoughts and emotion within
[02:38.39]Unknown to me, a brand new feeling
[02:41.64]And, on the day I took the step for the first time
[02:45.14]Including even this, new pain that I felt too
[02:49.14]Liking what I believe in and facing it led
[02:52.64]To a touch of the preview of a light
[02:55.89]Gonna be alright, let us go
[02:58.14]All I can do now is to have the fun
[03:03.14]Ah, Everything is on the line as I draw
[03:06.89]Using my own unique usage of colors and
[03:10.52]Every dawn, every night, I would keep on running
[03:14.02]And now I found the blue glowing light on me
[03:17.52]Liking what you believe in and facing it too
[03:21.02]Can be still terrifying but now I know
[03:24.27]No longer am I these versions of me living in transparency
[03:30.52]Ah, Now I know how to be my precious incomparable new self
[03:36.02]See what, see what, covered deep inside
[03:38.77]Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on
[03:42.77]Pretending won’t bring it out of sight
[03:45.65]It is always waiting there, still always waiting there for you and
[03:50.15]See what, see what, covered deep inside
[03:52.90]Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on
[03:57.28]Pretending won’t bring it out of sight
[04:00.02]It is always waiting there, waiting inside of you`
